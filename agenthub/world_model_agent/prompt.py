# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your answer:
<explanation>
Describe what the action to be taken is trying to do using a single concise sentence. Break down the active strategy into individual, manageable actions. Avoid long, complex search terms. Focus on the single action. Use first-person perspective like "I am doing something." If you encounter trouble using the search button, try hitting enter on the search box instead. If you fail to click on something, try scrolling down by 500 pixels first. If an element is no longer visible, try scrolling up by 500 pixels. Use clear and simple language to describe your action.
</explanation>\

<action>
Based on the current observation, state, active strategy, and action history, select one single action to be executed. Use only one action at a time. You must not enclose bid inputs in [brackets]. Interact only with elements in the current observation. Your response will be executed as a Python function call, so ensure it adheres to the format and argument data type specifications defined in the action space.
</action>

Note any dialogs, progress indicators, or significant changes such as items in your cart or sites visited. Describe the impact of your previous action on the webpage, including any new interactive elements. Include any inferred information that may help achieve the goal. Information from steps earlier are for reference only. Focus on objective description of the current observation and any inferences you can draw from it. Report any error messages displayed. Do not include your next planned actions; focus solely on providing an objective summary.

<state>
The previous action resulted in a timeout error, indicating no changes were made to the page. Thus far, I have visited ABC.com and DEF.com, discovering information G and H, respectively. The current page contains a dialog prompting whether to add protection, offering coverage options and the choices "Add Protection" or "No Thanks". A link indicates "1 item in cart", revealing a cellphone in the cart with a subtotal of $345. I searched for a 5-night hotel stay, but results only showed availability for a 6-night stay, suggesting a 5-night stay is unavailable. The page displays:
- An empty textbox in the middle labeled "Date", indicating it is likely for date input.
- A button below labeled "Submit" positioned below textbox 123, suggesting it submits the date entered in the textbox.
Additionally, there are:
- A notification below the button displaying "Error: Invalid date format" when attempting to submit the date.
- A dropdown menu labeled "Room Type" containing options "Single", "Double", and "Suite".
- A section showing "Total Price: $0.00", implying the total cost updates dynamically based on selections.
The page did not display any new errors after the latest action, apart from the timeout issue.
I clicked the "Submit" button on the booking form, but no confirmation message appeared, and the page did not change. There is no indication whether the submission was successful or not. I need to reassess the page for any subtle changes or possible errors.

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your answer:
<strategy>
Given that previous actions have been completed and the environment has transitioned to the current inferred state, describe the next action to achieve the goal. Break down the goal into clear, manageable steps. Avoid using phrases such as "To accomplish the goal," "I will," "To proceed," or "Assume the previous strategies have been carried out." Refrain from mentioning specific element IDs as they may change during execution. Limit your response to one sentence and include any details that help select the correct action. Be creative and propose novel methods to achieve the goal. Avoid creating accounts without user permission or providing personal information.

<next_state>
Assume the environment is at the current inferred state and your proposed strategy has been applied. Predict the new state of the webpage after executing each part of the proposed strategy. Describe the expected changes in page content, any new information relevant to your goal, and how interactive elements might change. Pay close attention to how the details of elements will be altered. Identify the new elements you can interact with on the updated webpage.

<progress>
Evaluate the previous and current states of the browser environment. Classify your status into one of three categories based on your progress towards the goal:

"in-progress" - You are still working towards achieving the goal.
"not-sure" - It's unclear if the goal has been achieved.
"goal-reached" - You have successfully completed the goal.

<next_state>
A dropdown menu appears below the textbox, listing various predefined options based on the initial input.
The textbox now contains the text "quote" and displays suggested completions as a dropdown list.
The page shows:
- A textbox labeled "quote" filled with the text "quote on."
- A dropdown list beneath the textbox containing items such as "quote on insurance," "quote on travel," and "quote on booking," each selectable.
- A "Submit" button below the textbox, which can be clicked to submit the selected or typed input to the backend.
- A notification area above the form indicating any immediate feedback or errors from previous actions, currently displaying "Please complete all required fields."
- Additional form fields dynamically appearing based on previous selections, such as a date picker or additional textboxes for more specific information related to the chosen quote option.
I have filled out most of the booking form but still need to select a room type before submission. The form fields are populated, but the "Submit" button remains inactive until all required fields are completed.

Observe your current state and proposed strategy in the browser environment, classify the proposed strategy into one of four categories based on progress towards your goal. The categories are:

1. "towards-the-goal" - You are moving closer to achieving the goal.
2. "not-sure" - It's unclear if the action are helping reach the goal.
3. "away-from-the-goal" - Your actions are diverting from the goal.
